# The Road Less Travelled

## Description

Over these last couple years, what travel looks like has changed drastically. Keeping this in mind, The Road Less Travelled aims to be a resource that enables the user to experience the province of Ontario as never before seen by enabling the user to browse through a database curated by other users. The database of travel destinations is catagorized into 5 categories: Entertainment, Food, Drinks, Stays and Outdoor. Upon log-in to the site, the user is able to create a profile that is unique to themselves. Once this is done, they are able to upload different destinations that they have been to for other users to enjoy.
